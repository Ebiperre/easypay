This code defines a functional component called Happy that displays a grid of cards containing images and text. The Happy component is imported from the react library at the top of the file. It also imports three named exports called Card1, Card2, and Card3 from a local file.

The Happy component returns a div element with several children elements, including a span element with a title and a div element with a grid of cards. The div elements have various class names applied to them, which are used to style the component.

The grid of cards uses the map function to iterate over an array of objects called peoples and render a div element for each object. Each div element contains an img element that displays one of the imported images and a div element with text.

Finally, the Happy component is exported as the default export of the file, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
