This code defines a functional component called Payments that renders a div element containing some content. The Payments component is imported from the react library at the top of the file. It also imports a named export called Lady from a local file.

The Payments component returns a div element with several children elements, including an img element that displays the Lady image and a button element. The div elements have various class names applied to them, which are used to style the component.

Finally, the Payments component is exported as the default export of the file, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
