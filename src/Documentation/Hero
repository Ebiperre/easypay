The import statement is used to import functions, objects, or primitive values from external modules and bind them to variables that are declared in the current scope.

In this code snippet, the import statement is used to import the React module from the package react, and the Hand and Hover exports from the current directory (.).

The Hero component is a function that returns a JSX element. It consists of a div element with two child elements, one for the left side and one for the right side. The left side contains a heading, a paragraph, and two buttons, while the right side displays two images, one of which is only visible when hovering over the element.

The Hero component is then exported as the default export, making it available for other modules to import and use.
