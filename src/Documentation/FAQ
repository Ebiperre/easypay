This code defines a functional component called Faq that displays a div element containing some content and an image. The Faq component is imported from the react library at the top of the file. It also imports a named export called Man from a local file.

The Faq component returns a div element with several children elements, including a span element with text and an img element. The div elements have various class names applied to them, which are used to style the component.

The img element displays the Man image.

Finally, the Faq component is exported as the default export of the file, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
