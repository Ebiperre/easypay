The import statement is used to import functions, objects, or primitive values from external modules and bind them to variables that are declared in the current scope.

In this code snippet, the import statement is used to import the React module from the package react, and the Tv, Phone, Globe, and Electricity exports from the current directory (.).

The Services component is a function that returns a JSX element. It contains a list of objects with information about different services that can be paid for, such as TV bills, electricity bills, airtime, and data.

The Services component displays this information in a grid of cards, where each card contains an image and text describing the service. The cards are generated using the map function, which iterates over the list of objects and creates a new element for each object.

The Services component is then exported as the default export, making it available for other modules to import and use.
