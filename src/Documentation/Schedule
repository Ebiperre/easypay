This code defines a functional component called Schedule that displays a list of items in a series of div elements. The Schedule component is imported from the react library at the top of the file. It also imports two named exports called Blue and Guy from a local file.

The Schedule component returns a div element with several children elements, including an img element that displays the Blue and Guy images, and a button element. The div elements have various class names applied to them, which are used to style the component.

The Schedule component uses the map function to iterate over an array of objects called items and render a div element for each object. Each div element contains a span element with a number and a div element with a title and info.

Finally, the Schedule component is exported as the default export of the file, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
